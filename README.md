  ## Installation
  Used NPM  to install Inquirer, MySQL and Console.Table

  ## Usage
* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
